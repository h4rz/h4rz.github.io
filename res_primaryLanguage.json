      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Harsh Rajgor. I'm passionate about meeting new people, learning about new technologies. As a Computer Science student, I do not limit myself just to computers, I like to build a product by combining different technologies. I'm a Computer Science Graduate student at the University of Texas at Dallas focusing on the Intelligent Systems track and will be graduating in June 2023. I'm an Android Developer with around 2 years of experience and currently, I'm diving into Machine Learning and iOS development (If you are looking to colloborate, hit me up!). Outside the classroom, I play table tennis, binge series/anime and also love reading books as it puts me into relexation mode.",
