      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Harsh Rajgor, a Software Engineer II at Copart with expertise in mobile development across Android and React Native platforms. I graduated with a Master's in Computer Science from The University of Texas at Dallas in 2023, where I specialized in Intelligent Systems. I have a proven track record of delivering impactful solutions, from leading core feature development for Copart's mobile apps to creating innovative solutions like an edge detection algorithm that reduced costs by 85% at Unifynd. I'm particularly passionate about mobile architecture, having worked with modern frameworks and patterns like Jetpack Compose, MVI, and MVVM. When I'm not coding, you can find me playing table tennis, catching up on anime, or unwinding with a good book. I'm always eager to collaborate on interesting projects and explore new technologies - feel free to reach out!",
